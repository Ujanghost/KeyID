# Keystroke Dynamics Data Collection Tool

This Python script is designed to collect and analyze keystroke dynamics, which can be used to identify unique typing patterns. The tool runs in the background and automatically logs parameters such as dwell time, flight time, typing speed, and error rate. The collected data is saved in a CSV file for future analysis and model training.

## Features

- **Real-time Keystroke Monitoring**: Tracks and logs key press and release times.
- **Dwell Time Calculation**: Measures the time a key is held down (dwell time).
- **Flight Time Calculation**: Measures the time between consecutive key presses (flight time).
- **Error Rate Tracking**: Tracks the number of errors based on backspace usage.
- **Typing Speed Calculation**: Calculates the typing speed in characters per minute.
- **Automatic Data Logging**: Saves the collected typing data into a CSV file in the directory where the program is stored.
- **Background Execution**: Monitors keystrokes in the background while the user types.

## Neural Network and Deep Learning Integration

### Overview

This tool incorporates neural networks (NN) and deep learning (DL) technologies to identify individuals based on their unique typing patterns. The model uses a combination of traditional keystroke dynamics parameters and additional features like typing speed and error rate, providing better accuracy and efficiency.

- **Neural Networks (NN)**: Neural networks are trained to recognize typing patterns and identify users based on their behavior. The collected parameters are fed into the neural network, which then learns the user's unique keystroke dynamics over time.
- **Deep Learning (DL)**: Advanced deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are used to improve the prediction capabilities by learning complex relationships between the parameters.
  
### Model Architecture

- **Input Layer**: Receives data such as dwell time, flight time, typing speed, and error rate.
- **Hidden Layers**: Consists of multiple dense layers that help in learning non-linear relationships between the inputs.
- **Output Layer**: Provides predictions on user identity by comparing typing data with stored profiles.

Here's a simple illustration of how the neural network works:

### Deep Learning in Action

The deep learning model can recognize complex patterns like common digraph times (e.g., "th," "he") and error patterns, which might not be noticeable through traditional statistical methods. Below is a visual demonstration of deep learning models learning from keystroke dynamics:

## Data Collected

The script collects the following data points and saves them into a CSV file:

- `user_id`: A unique identifier for the user (default: "User_1").
- `avg_dwell_time`: The average time a key is held down.
- `avg_flight_time`: The average time between key presses.
- `typing_speed`: The typing speed calculated in characters per minute.
- `error_rate`: The percentage of errors (based on backspace usage).
- `timestamp`: The time when the data was recorded.

### Example Data Flow

1. **Keystrokes Captured**: Key press and release times are recorded.
2. **Parameters Calculated**: Dwell times, flight times, typing speed, and error rate are calculated.
3. **Model Training**: Data is passed through a neural network to train the system to recognize unique typing styles.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- `pynput` library for capturing keystrokes.
- `csv` module (included with Python)
- Any necessary libraries like `os` (included with Python)

### Install `pynput`:

```bash
pip install pynput
```

## How to Use

1. **Download or Clone the Repository**: 

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/keystroke-dynamics-tool.git
   ```

2. **Run the Script**:

   Navigate to the directory where the script is located and run:

   ```bash
   python typing_data_collector.py
   ```

3. **Start Typing**: 

   Once the script starts, begin typing in any application. The tool will record your typing patterns in the background. Press `Esc` to stop the data collection.

4. **Check the Output**: 

   A CSV file (`typing_data.csv`) will be automatically created in the same directory as the script. This file will contain the collected data, which can be used for training machine learning models or conducting further analysis.

### CSV File Example

Here’s an example of how the CSV file looks:

| user_id | avg_dwell_time | avg_flight_time | typing_speed | error_rate | timestamp           |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|--------------|------------|---------------------|
| User_1  | 0.1025         | 0.2301          | 35.5         | 2          | 2024-09-05 14:32:10 |
| User_2  | 0.0987         | 0.2154          | 42.3         | 1          | 2024-09-05 14:35:22 |

## Customization

### Change the `user_id`

By default, the `user_id` is set to `User_1`. You can modify this by changing the value in the `typing_data` dictionary:

```python
typing_data['user_id'] = 'Custom_User_ID'
```

### Modify Collected Data

You can easily add or modify parameters to collect more detailed typing behavior by modifying the dictionary structure in the script.

## Dependencies

The script depends on the following Python packages:

- `pynput`: For capturing keyboard input.
- `csv`: For saving the collected data in a CSV format.

Install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pynput
```
